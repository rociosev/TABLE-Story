Statistics often rank counties in North Carolina as some of the poorest in the nation.
We looked at the amount of children receiving special food benefits in the areas of Carborro, Chapel Hill, and Durham County. We worked with TABLE (TABLE) to learn how many children benefit from their program on a weekly basis and gathered data from data.gov to see how many children in Durham county receive free and reduced lunch. Based on the data.gov information we looked at how N.C. ranks among its neighboring states. Take a look!
